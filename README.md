# Flight Status Tool for United Airlines

This tool is used to access the United Airlines flight status page before the link is available on the [united.com](http://www.united.com/) reservation page. For example, to see those who have already been upgraded (miles, RPU, GPU, or CPU), and for those who are waiting for "battlefield" (at the gate) upgrades. Please see the [united.com Legal Infomration](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/legal.aspx). 

## Installation (Web Server)

1. Move the "unted_flight_link.css" and "united_flight_link.html" files to an accessible place on your web-server.
